# Project Status Migration: "in_progress" → "active"

## Overview
Successfully removed the "in_progress" status from both backend and frontend, simplifying the project status system to use "active" and "completed" statuses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Prisma Schema (`/http-backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- ✅ Updated `JobStatus` enum: `in_progress` → `active`
- ✅ Regenerated Prisma Client with new enum values

#### Routes Updated
- ✅ `/http-backend/src/routes/projects.ts`
  - Changed milestone submission validation to check for "pending" status
  - Removed restriction that only current stage milestone can be submitted
  - Added check to ensure project is "active" before submission
  - Removed automatic milestone status progression to "in_progress"
  
- ✅ `/http-backend/src/routes/staking.ts`
  - Project creation now uses `status: 'active'` instead of `'in_progress'`
  - All milestones created with `status: 'pending'` (no special case for stage 1)
  - Job status updated to `'active'` when project starts

- ✅ `/http-backend/src/routes/escrow.ts`
  - Project creation uses `status: 'active'`
  - All milestones created with `status: 'pending'`
  - Job status updated to `'active'` when escrow verified

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### ProjectWorkspace (`/frontend/src/pages/ProjectWorkspace.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed "in_progress" from milestone status checks
- ✅ Submission form now shows for milestones with status "pending" or "revision_requested"
- ✅ Project status check simplified to only `project.status === "active"`
- ✅ Removed "in_progress" from milestone status color function
- ✅ Removed test "Send recruiter 'Hi!!!'" button

#### FreelancerDashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/FreelancerDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Active projects filter changed from `"in_progress"` to `"active"`
- ✅ Verify Funds button condition updated to check for `"active"` status
- ✅ Project status badge styling updated for `"active"` status

#### RecruiterDashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/RecruiterDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Stats calculation: `inProgressJobs` → `activeJobs`
- ✅ Tab label changed from "In Progress" to "Active"
- ✅ Status color function updated: `"in_progress"` → `"active"`
- ✅ Verify Funds button condition updated

#### Types (`/frontend/src/integrations/apiClient/types.ts`)
- ✅ Updated `job_status` enum: `"in_progress"` → `"active"`
- ✅ Updated Constants export with new enum values

### 3. Database Migration

#### Migration File (`/http-backend/prisma/migrations/rename_in_progress_to_active.sql`)
Created migration script that:
1. Adds 'active' value to job_status enum
2. Updates all existing 'in_progress' jobs to 'active'
3. Updates all existing 'in_progress' milestones to 'pending'

**To apply the migration:**
```bash
cd http-backend
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/rename_in_progress_to_active.sql
```

## New Behavior

### For Freelancers:
- Can submit **any milestone** with "pending" status when project is "active"
- No longer restricted to only submitting the "current stage" milestone
- All 3 milestones are available for submission simultaneously

### For Recruiters:
- Projects start with status "active" (not "in_progress")
- Can review and approve milestones in any order
- Dashboard shows "Active" tab instead of "In Progress"

### Milestone Flow:
1. **Project Created** → All milestones set to "pending"
2. **Freelancer Submits** → Milestone changes to "submitted"
3. **Recruiter Reviews** → 
   - Approve → "approved" + payment released
   - Request Revision → "revision_requested"
4. **All Milestones Approved** → Project status changes to "completed"

## Status Values Reference

### Job/Project Status:
- `draft` - Job is being created
- `open` - Job is published and accepting applications
- `active` - Project is ongoing (freelancer selected, work in progress)
- `completed` - Project finished
- `cancelled` - Project cancelled

### Milestone Status:
- `pending` - Not yet submitted
- `submitted` - Waiting for review
- `approved` - Approved and paid
- `revision_requested` - Needs changes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Restart backend server
- [ ] Test freelancer can submit all 3 milestones on active project
- [ ] Test recruiter dashboard shows "Active" tab
- [ ] Test project creation sets status to "active"
- [ ] Test milestone approval flow
- [ ] Verify no "in_progress" references remain in code

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration to update existing data
2. Restart the backend server to use new Prisma client
3. Test the changes in development environment
4. Deploy to production when ready
