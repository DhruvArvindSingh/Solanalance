## Test Coverage

### 1. Escrow Creation Tests
- ✅ Creates job escrow with correct PDA derivation using SHA-256 hash
- ✅ Locks funds correctly in escrow account
- ✅ Validates milestone amounts (rejects zero amounts)
- ✅ Stores job metadata correctly

### 2. Access Control Tests
- ✅ Prevents non-recruiter from approving milestones
- ✅ Prevents non-freelancer from claiming payments
- ✅ Validates signer authority using `has_one` constraints

### 3. Milestone Approval Tests

- ✅ Prevents double approval of same milestone
- ✅ Updates approval state correctly

### 4. Payment Claim Tests
- ✅ Allows freelancer to claim approved milestones
- ✅ Prevents claiming unapproved milestones

- ✅ Multiple escrow accounts can coexist independently

## Key Implementation Details

### PDA Derivation
The contract uses SHA-256 hashing for job_id seeds:
```rust
fn hash_job_id(job_id: &str) -> [u8; 32] {
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(job_id.as_bytes());
    hasher.finalize().into()
}
```

Tests mirror this with:
```typescript
function hashJobId(jobId: string): Buffer {
  return createHash("sha256").update(jobId).digest();
}
```

### Escrow Seeds
```
["escrow", recruiter_pubkey, hash_job_id(job_id)]
```

## Running Tests

### Localnet (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
cd /home/dhruv/C_drive/Code/solana-lance-hq/contract
anchor test
```

This will:
1. Build the program
2. Start a local Solana validator
3. Deploy the program with the specified Program ID
4. Run all 12 tests
5. Clean up the validator

### Devnet

**Note**: Devnet has strict rate limits on airdrops. For reliable testing, use localnet or manually fund test wallets.

1. Update `Anchor.toml`:
```toml
[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
```

2. Fund a test wallet manually (get SOL from https://faucet.solana.com)

3. Run tests without deploying:
```bash
anchor test --skip-deploy
```
