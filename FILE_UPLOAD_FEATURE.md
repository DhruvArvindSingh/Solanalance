# File Upload Feature for Milestone Submissions

## Overview
Added file upload functionality to allow freelancers to attach files when submitting milestones for review.

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Selection
- **Multiple files**: Freelancers can select multiple files at once
- **File limit**: Maximum 5 files per milestone
- **Size limit**: 10MB per file
- **Accepted formats**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, ZIP, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF

### 2. File Management
- **Preview selected files**: Shows file name and size before upload
- **Remove files**: Can remove individual files before submission
- **Visual feedback**: Clear UI showing all selected files

### 3. Upload Process
- **Progress indication**: Shows "Uploading files..." status
- **Error handling**: Validates file size and count before upload
- **Toast notifications**: Informs user of upload progress and completion

### 4. UI Components

#### File Input Field
```tsx
<Input
  type="file"
  multiple
  accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt,.zip,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.gif"
  onChange={(e) => handleFileSelect(milestoneId, e.target.files)}
/>
```

#### File Preview List
- Shows each selected file with:
  - File icon
  - File name (truncated if too long)
  - File size in KB
  - Remove button (X icon)

### 5. State Management

New state variables:
- `submissionFiles`: Stores selected files per milestone
- `uploadingFiles`: Tracks upload status per milestone

### 6. Validation

**File Size Validation:**
- Checks each file is ≤ 10MB
- Shows error toast if any file exceeds limit

**File Count Validation:**
- Maximum 5 files per milestone
- Shows error toast if limit exceeded

## Current Implementation

### Placeholder Upload
Currently, files are stored as placeholder names (timestamp + filename). This is because:
- No S3/cloud storage is configured yet
- Backend upload endpoint needs to be implemented

### Production TODO
To enable actual file uploads:

1. **Backend**: Create upload endpoint in `/http-backend/src/routes/upload.ts`
2. **S3 Setup**: Configure AWS S3 bucket or alternative storage
3. **Frontend**: Uncomment production upload code in `uploadFilesToS3` function

```typescript
// Production implementation (currently commented):
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', file);
formData.append('type', 'milestone');
const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});
const data = await response.json();
uploadedUrls.push(data.url);
```

## User Experience

### Freelancer Flow:
1. Navigate to project workspace
2. Find milestone to submit
3. Fill in description (required)
4. Add links (optional)
5. **Upload files (optional)** ← NEW
6. Click "Submit for Review"

### Visual States:
- **Idle**: "Submit for Review" button
- **Uploading**: "Uploading files..." with spinner
- **Submitting**: "Submitting..." with spinner
- **Success**: Toast notification + form reset

## Files Modified

## Next Steps

- The UI is fully functional and ready for production upload integration
- File metadata (name, size) is validated client-side for better UX
